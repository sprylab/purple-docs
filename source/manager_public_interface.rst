Manager public REST interface

Before starting with specific APIs we give an overview of the basic data model and the complete workflow from login to upload of packages.

Data model
##########

  :alt: Data model

  Publication and issue data model

Workflow
########

At first you have to `Login`_ to the Purple DS | Manager. That generates a :code:`sessionID` used for all other API calls.

The second step is to retrieve an ID of a publication for which an issue will be edited.
Therefore a `Publication list`_ containing all publications visible to the logged in user may be requested.
From the result the publication name may be used to identify a specific publication.

Using the publication ID, either a new issue is created by `Create issue`_
or the list of all issues of that publication is requested by `Issue list`_.
Again the issue name may be used to identify a specific issue and the ID is used for further operations.

Now in a similar way an issue version is created by `Create issue version`_
or requested from the list of versions of this issue to be retrieved by `Issue version list`_.

.. hint:: As a matter of fact when creating an issue, a first issue version is created automatically.
    Therefore, the latter is most probably what you would do.

Using the version ID, new packages for this issue version can be uploaded. The packages contain the actual issue data.
A package is uploaded to an issue version by `Upload package`_ and then
the issue version is published by `Change issue version status`_.

Don't forget to `Logout`_ to invalidate the :code:`sessionID` when you are done.

The following picture shows the complete workflow needed for publishing a new issue for an existing publication
including the propagation of the necessary ID parameters from one request to another.

  :alt: Simple workflow

  Simple workflow to publish a new issue

For more sophisticated use cases, one can upload multiple packages to an issue version and
`Associate package with platforms or device classes`_.
In order to have all parameter values for these constraints, the global `Configuration`_ -
containing the lists of platforms and device types - has to be queried once.

Furthermore, additional assets like videos or music can be added by `Upload package`_,
preview or "coming soon" versions can be created and many more. All of this is laid out in detail in the following text.

API Description
###############

This chapter describes all APIs to fulfill the package management workflow explained before.

Create issue version
====================

Shall a package be uploaded into a new version of an issue, it has to be created beforehand.
Every issue has a first version (number 1) created automatically when the issue is created.

Besides the "full version" of an issue there may be "customer preview versions" used to present part of an issue to the customer for free.
For these "customer preview versions" the first version has to be created by this API call explicitly.

=============== ======= ===================================================================================================

Result
------

The result is the id of the new issue version.

----

Issue version list
==================

Having the list of all versions of an issue, one may pick a version by its version number or the status (published, preview or "coming soon")
and use the id of this version in subsequent calls.

[GET] /issue/listversions

Request Parameters
------------------

=============== ======= ============================================================================================================
Parameter name  Type    Description
=============== ======= ============================================================================================================
sessionID       String  Valid session token created by `Login`_.

=============== ======= ============================================================================================================

Result
------

The result is a JSON array containing all versions of the given issue. Each version is a JSON object with the following relevant properties:

========== ======= ==========================================================================================
Field      Type    Description
========== ======= ==========================================================================================
id         String  Version id that may be used in subsequent API calls
number     Integer Version number
active     Boolean Flag indicating whether this version is published in release app.
preview    Boolean Flag indicating whether this version is published in preview app.
========== ======= ==========================================================================================

----

Change issue version status
===========================

In order to change issue version status there are activating and deactivating API calls for each of the status flags:
:code:`active` (published to release and preview app) and :code:`preview` (published to preview app).
These calls are distinguished by their path.

.. note:: For backward compatibility reasons the issue status :code:`comingSoon` can be set through a version as well.

Boundary conditions
-------------------

1. In order to Change issue version status to be published into the release app, there needs to be a bundle uploaded,
   see `Upload package`_.
2. If a version is published to release or preview app, the same status of another version is automatically deleted,
   so there is always exactly one issue version published to release or preview app.
3. A version published to release app cannot be modified afterwards, a new version has to be created instead.
4. Setting :code:`comingSoon` for an issue resets any versions :code:`active` status and vice versa.

================================ ============================= ============================================
Purpose                          Call
================================ ============================= ============================================

Unpublish from release app       [POST] /version/deactivate
Publish to preview app           [POST] /version/preview
Unpublish from preview app       [POST] /version/notpreview

Dynamic Resources
#################

An app uses various resources which can be changed at runtime. They are packaged into a zip file and uploaded to the Purple DS | Manager.
The required structure of the zipped content is described at :doc:`Dynamic Resources<dynamic_resources>`.
Once uploaded, the resource file becomes valid immediately and is downloaded by the app at the next start or resume.

Upload dynamic resources for an app
===================================

A new version of the dynamic resource file can be uploaded by a multipart HTTP POST request (content-type: multipart/form-data).
